# MittagLefflerFunctions.jl

This unregistered package implements several algorithms described in the (not yet published) paper *Numerical evaluation of Mittag-Leffler functions*. The `examples` folder contains scripts that generate the figures and tables in the paper.

Note: some of the scripts depend on the unregistered package `RationalApproximations`.
